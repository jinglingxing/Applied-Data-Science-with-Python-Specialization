# Applied-Data-Science-with-Python-Specialization
Including 4 courses on Coursera, keep updating...
The code is simply understanding with notes and comments.
## 1. Introduction to Data Science in Python
### week 2:
Using pandas to solve 8 problems, like the question 7 #Which county has had the largest absolute change in population within the period 2010-2015? #(Hint: population values are stored in columns POPESTIMATE2010 through POPESTIMATE2015)
### week 3:
This assignment requires more individual learning then the last one did - you are encouraged to check out the pandas documentation to find functions or methods you might not have used yet, or ask questions on Stack Overflow and tag them as pandas and python related. And of course, the discussion forums are open for interaction with your peers and the course staff.

## 1. Applied machine learning in Python
### assignment 1:
For this assignment, you will be using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Database to create a classifier that can help diagnose patients. First, read through the description of the dataset (below).
### assignment 2:
In this assignment you'll explore the relationship between model complexity and generalization performance, by adjusting key parameters of various supervised learning models. Part 1 of this assignment will look at regression and Part 2 will look at classification.
