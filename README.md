# Applied-Data-Science-with-Python-Specialization
Including 4 courses on Coursera, keep updating...
The code is simply understanding with notes and comments.
## 1. Introduction to Data Science in Python
### week 2:
Using pandas to solve 8 problems, like the question 7 #Which county has had the largest absolute change in population within the period 2010-2015? #(Hint: population values are stored in columns POPESTIMATE2010 through POPESTIMATE2015)
### week 3:
This assignment requires more individual learning then the last one did - you are encouraged to check out the pandas documentation to find functions or methods you might not have used yet, or ask questions on Stack Overflow and tag them as pandas and python related. And of course, the discussion forums are open for interaction with your peers and the course staff.
### week 4:
This assignment requires more individual learning than previous assignments - you are encouraged to check out the pandas documentation to find functions or methods you might not have used yet, or ask questions on Stack Overflow and tag them as pandas and python related. And of course, the discussion forums are open for interaction with your peers and the course staff.

## 3. Applied machine learning in Python
### assignment 1:
For this assignment, you will be using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Database to create a classifier that can help diagnose patients. First, read through the description of the dataset (below).
### assignment 2:
In this assignment you'll explore the relationship between model complexity and generalization performance, by adjusting key parameters of various supervised learning models. Part 1 of this assignment will look at regression and Part 2 will look at classification.
### assignment 3:
In this assignment you will train several models and evaluate how effectively they predict instances of fraud using data based on this dataset from Kaggle. Each row in fraud_data.csv corresponds to a credit card transaction. Features include confidential variables V1 through V28 as well as Amount which is the amount of the transaction. The target is stored in the class column, where a value of 1 corresponds to an instance of fraud and 0 corresponds to an instance of not fraud.
### assignment 4:
This assignment is based on a data challenge from the Michigan Data Science Team (MDST).
The Michigan Data Science Team (MDST) and the Michigan Student Symposium for Interdisciplinary Statistical Sciences (MSSISS) have partnered with the City of Detroit to help solve one of the most pressing problems facing Detroit - blight. Blight violations are issued by the city to individuals who allow their properties to remain in a deteriorated condition. Every year, the city of Detroit issues millions of dollars in fines to residents and every year, many of these fines remain unpaid. Enforcing unpaid blight fines is a costly and tedious process, so the city wants to know: how can we increase blight ticket compliance?
The first step in answering this question is understanding when and why a resident might fail to comply with a blight ticket. This is where predictive modeling comes in. For this assignment, your task is to predict whether a given blight ticket will be paid on time.
